# AutoAttend App
AutoAttend is an android application that allows teachers to seamlessly track the attendance of their students. This will be done by having the teachers set up a Bluetooth beacon device at any part of the classroom. Teachers will be responsible for maintaining a list of students in each of their classes. Students will need to register their devices with the Bluetooth beacon so that connection will occur automatically once they are inside of the classroom. The beacon will attempt to ping the students’ devices repeatedly throughout the duration of the class to ensure that students have not departed earlier than the end of class. At the end of each class, a detailed report will be made available to teachers specifying each student’s attendance information. This will include whether or not a student showed up to class and the amount of time the student spent in class. An aggregate of all reports can be created to show trends and statistics of the collective class attendance performance as well as that of individual students.
